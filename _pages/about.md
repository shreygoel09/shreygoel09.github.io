Hey there! I'm Shrey, an undergraduate student at Duke University studying Computer Science broadly interested in generative models for biology. Currently, I'm focusing on on discrete diffusion models and classifier-guided sampling algorithms. I work with [Dr. Pranam Chatterjee](https://www.chatterjeelab.com/) at the University of Pennsylvania and [Latus Bio](https://www.latusbio.com/). Previously, I was a ML Engineer Intern at Qualcomm Technologies where I worked on LLM efficiency. I'm always open to new collaborations and opportunities, so please feel free to reach out!
