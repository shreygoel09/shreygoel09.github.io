Hey there! I'm Shrey, an undergraduate student at Duke University broadly interested in generative models for biology. Currently, I'm focusing on on discrete diffusion models and classifier-guided sampling algorithms under the mentorship of [Dr. Pranam Chatterjee](https://www.chatterjeelab.com/) at the University of Pennsylvania. On the side, I work part-time at [Latus Bio](https://www.latusbio.com/) to build their ML-based drug discovery pipeline. Previously, I was a ML Engineer Intern at [Qualcomm Technologies](https://www.qualcomm.com) where I worked on LLM efficiency.

Please feel free to reach out -- I'm always open to new collaborations and opportunities!
